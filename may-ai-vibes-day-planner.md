üß† May AI Vibes ‚Äì Day Planner

Web app that connects to your Google Calendar and Notion to-do list, then creates an intelligent daily plan with an email summary every morning.

üöÄ What It Does
The Day Planner app is your AI-powered personal assistant. It pulls in your scheduled meetings and tasks from Google Calendar and Notion, and intelligently arranges your day ‚Äî ensuring goals are met, tasks are completed, and you're never double-booked. You'll receive a clear plan every morning via email to start your day with clarity.

	‚Ä¢	Connects to Google Calendar to import meetings and time blocks
	‚Ä¢	Syncs with your Notion to-do list (including tasks and meetings)
	‚Ä¢	Analyses your day and schedules to-dos around existing commitments
	‚Ä¢	Supports task prioritisation, time estimates, and deadlines
	‚Ä¢	Generates a daily timeline with tasks and events
	‚Ä¢	Sends a morning email summary with your schedule and tasks
	‚Ä¢	Continuously adapts to changes and missed tasks

üéØ Scope
Start with an MVP that integrates Google Calendar and Notion, generates a simple daily plan with prioritised tasks, and delivers a summary email. Future versions can add learning-based planning, energy/time preference tuning, Slack reminders, and mobile support.

‚öôÔ∏è Behaviour
	‚Ä¢	Schedules to-do tasks intelligently into free calendar slots
	‚Ä¢	Respects existing meetings and busy hours
	‚Ä¢	Replans when meetings change or tasks are incomplete
	‚Ä¢	Delivers a clear and concise email every morning with your full day
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight web interface for viewing/editing the plan

üß± Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Python (FastAPI)
	‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQL
	‚Ä¢	Integrations: Google Calendar API, Notion API, Gmail API or SMTP
	‚Ä¢	Scheduler: APScheduler or Celery
	‚Ä¢	Auth: Google OAuth

## Implementation Steps (Session Summary)

1.  **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Created backend (`FastAPI`) and frontend (`React + Vite + TypeScript`) directory structure within `personal-ai-organiser/`.
    *   Set up basic FastAPI application (`main.py`) and backend `requirements.txt`.
    *   Initialized React frontend using Vite and configured Tailwind CSS.
    *   Added `.gitignore` and basic `README.md` (implied).
2.  **Backend Placeholders:**
    *   Created placeholder Python modules for Google Calendar (`google_calendar.py`), Notion (`notion.py`), Email (`email_sender.py`), Scheduler (`scheduler.py`), Auth (`auth.py`), Database models (`models.py`), and Core logic (`core.py`).
    *   Added example environment file (`backend/.env.example`, later moved).
3.  **Frontend Placeholders:**
    *   Created placeholder React components: `Dashboard.tsx`, `CalendarView.tsx`, `TaskListView.tsx`, `TimelineView.tsx`.
    *   Updated `App.tsx` to render the main `Dashboard`.
4.  **Initial Implementation:**
    *   **Google Calendar:** Implemented fetching today's events (`get_calendar_events` in `google_calendar.py`) using Google Calendar API and OAuth2. Included creating and troubleshooting the initial token generation script (`quickstart.py`).
    *   **Notion:** Implemented fetching tasks from a specified database (`get_notion_tasks` in `notion.py`) using the Notion API client.
    *   **Core Logic:** Implemented core scheduling functions in `core.py`:
        *   `find_free_slots`: Calculates available time slots based on calendar events and working hours, handling timezones.
        *   `prioritize_tasks`: Sorts Notion tasks based on deadline and priority.
        *   `schedule_tasks`: Allocates prioritized tasks into free slots.
        *   `format_plan`: Combines events and scheduled tasks into a final sorted list.
    *   Added `pytz` dependency for timezone handling.
5.  **Cleanup:** Removed redundant `frontend` directory from the workspace root.
6.  **Backend Authentication & Database:**
    *   Added `User` and `OAuthToken` SQLAlchemy models (`models.py`).
    *   Configured SQLAlchemy engine, session (`SessionLocal`), and `get_db` dependency.
    *   Integrated database table creation (`create_db_tables`) on app startup.
    *   Added `itsdangerous` dependency and configured `SessionMiddleware` for session management (`main.py`).
    *   Implemented Google OAuth web authentication flow (`/auth/google`, `/auth/google/callback`) using `google-auth-oauthlib`.
    *   Implemented logic in callback to exchange code, fetch user info, create/update `User` and `OAuthToken` records in the database, and set user ID in session.
    *   Added `/user/me` endpoint to fetch logged-in user data from session/DB.
    *   Added `/auth/logout` endpoint to clear the session.
    *   Refactored `google_calendar.py` (`get_calendar_credentials`, `get_calendar_events`) to retrieve user-specific tokens from the database and handle token refresh/update in DB.
    *   Refactored `core.py` (`generate_daily_plan`) and `scheduler.py` (`daily_planning_and_email_job`) to accept `user_id` and `db` session for user-specific processing.
    *   Updated manual trigger endpoints (`/schedule/run/manual`, `/schedule/generate/manual`) to be user-specific and protected by authentication dependency.
    *   Ensured consistent relative imports within the backend package.
    *   Troubleshot and resolved various configuration and runtime errors (`redirect_uri_mismatch`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, `InsecureTransportError`, `Database not configured`).
